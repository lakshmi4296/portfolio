    <p><strong>Lakshmi Subramanian</strong></p>
    <p>I’m an <strong>AI/ML engineer</strong> who loves turning wild ideas into real AI that actually works.</p>
    <p>I build things that <strong>think</strong>, <strong>see</strong>, and sometimes even <strong>move</strong>. Case in point: this page… built with a bit of AI mischief.</p>

## What I Do
* Bring complex concepts to life with **AI that works in the real world**.
* Build systems spanning **ML**, **computer vision**, **robotics**, and **data engineering**.
* Picked up a few **patents** and shared some **publications**.
* Love making models fast smart, and actually useful.
* This page? Yep… AI helped me put it together. UX/full-stack, not my forte 😅.
