    <p><strong>Hi there! 👋</strong></p>
    <p>I’m an AI/ML engineer who loves turning wild ideas into real AI that actually works.</p>
    <p>I build things that think, see, and sometimes even move. Case in point: this page… built with a bit of AI mischief.</p>

## What I Do
* Bring complex concepts to life with AI that works in the real world.
* Build systems spanning ML, computer vision, robotics, and big data.
* Picked up a few patents along the way — no big deal.
* Love making models fast, smart, and actually useful.
* This page? Yep… AI helped me put it together. UX/full-stack, not my forte 😅.
